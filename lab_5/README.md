# Lab 5: fat file system with SPI to micro SD card adaptor device
[Lab5.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21922841/Lab5.pdf)

- Connect an external module to the development board to read and play WAV files from the micro SD card.
- Write data to the micro SD card.

**Implementation details**
- When the blue button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered, executing the callback function and notifying the button task.
- Inside the button task, the function GetButtonEvent() will be used, which returns whether the userâ€™s action is a single click, double click, or long press. The missing part needs to be implemented to complete this judgment.
